• Here working on ISCAS89 sequential benchmark circuit s27 then introducing some trojan inside the circuit 
then analysing with and without the trojan circuit transition period and detecting the trojan in the circuit.
• fully detected hardware trojans within the ISCAS89 sequential benchmark circuit s27.
• Demonstrated expertise in circuit analysis and hardware security.
